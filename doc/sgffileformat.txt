SGF format looks like...

(num of nodes)
(start node)
(edge)
(edge)
(and so on)



Example:

4
1
1 2
2 3
3 4

Note that any extra information at the end of the line is ignored
So you can do...

4 Num of nodes
1 Start Node
1 2 Edge 1
2 3 Edge 2
3 4 Edge that looks like waffles

It also ignores lines only containing whitespace

So you can do...
\t
\t\t\t
4

1

1 2




2 3
3 4
